sinfestas frameas saltu iaciunt.

voluntariam servitutem adit:

1. vinis C.

is noted in c. 4, 33 and their propensity

5. excitatio Cc. parat C.
tantium all others, text b.

6. mercede C.
9. defecerint b.

citari0.'' Gifts were later, perhaps al·

to drunkenness was taken advantage of ways, given, but it was not a trade,

inwar (A. 1. 50,6; H.4,79, 3).

1. haud minus facile, probably a
litotes for ‘facilius' He certainly would
not call it easy to subdue them by arms

c. r, a..

l gllGenlua, δια, ‘they have but one
(in contrast to the variety at Rome) and
in all gatherings the same public game'
This is the chief ancient account of what
(by disuse of the ‘framea’) was after-
wards known as the sword dance, kept
up till nearly recent times. The games
on horseback called ‘ tiost' (the ‘joust,'
the origin of the toumament) seem not
to have then existed.

4. nudi; in later times a shirt or
tunic was woru; and the word may be
tak6en here as thus qualified, or as in
c. ,2.

quibus, &c., ‘who make profession
of that exhibition ⁰ (cp. A. 1. 52, 4, &c.).
It seems not to have been practised
by all, and was probably confined to
ireemen.

5. infestae, ‘held menaeingly’ (cp.
‘infestis pilis,' H. 1, 31, 7), or perhaps
planted in the ground, point upwards:
‘saltu iaciuut’ is stronger than ‘sal-
tant.’

artem . . . decorem, ‘skill . . .
gracefulness.'

6. non in quaestum, ‘not with a
view to profit' (cp. ‘in terrorem,' c. 38,
4), sc. .‘ exercent,‘ supplied from ‘exer-

like that of Roman jugglerS, or prac-
tised for wages (‘ mercedem '), like the
gladiator's calling.

quamvis, &c.‚ ‘for recklessuess, how·
ever dariug.' It was, no doubt, in origin,
a religious act, probably in honour
of Tiu (Mars), and joined with the
feasts: ep. ‘noctem sollemnibus epulis
ludicram’ (A. 1. 50, 4).

7. aleam, &e At Rome dicing was
forbidden by law (see Hor. Od. 3. 24,
58), and, though no doubt common
enough, was tolerated only iu hours of
revelry, or at such times as the Satur·
nalia. ln later, times it was prohibitecl
also among the Germans.

8. interserta, ‘asoneoftheirearnest
occupations.' ,

which words expressiug the result are
substituted.

extremo ac novissimo,‘ the deci·
sive and last throw.’ The ideas are
virtually the same y for similar instanceS,
see lutrod. p. 10.

10. corpore, ‘ his person' A similar
custom is recorded of the Huns, and
88². alludes to a poem in the Rip-vedast
and other tales evidencing a prevalence
of gambling among the ancient Indians.

11. iuvenior. This rare comparative
form is found in Columella, Pliny mi„
and Appuleius.
