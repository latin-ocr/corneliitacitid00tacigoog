radios. It is thought that stories oi
Aurora borealis are alluded to, and
that some saw in the description a re-
semblance to* the ‘corona radiata’

persuasio, ‘belief,' which Tacitus
evidently did not share. The sun god
and his chariot are no doubt to him
mythical.

4. lingua Britannicae propior.
This is no doubt the vague informator,
probably oi amber tradem, who knew
that the language was not German,
and thought it souuded to the ear like
British. Tacitus had mentioned Gallic
speaking people in Germany (c. 43, 1),
and was aware of the resemblance of
British to Gallie (Agr. 11, 4), but
speaks here as if there was some
recognized difference. The language
of this people must, however, have had
more resemblance to German than to
any form of Celtic.

matrem deum. This worship,intro·
duced in rac. 207 from Phrygia, was
distinct to aRoman from that ol ‘Terra
mater’ (c. 40, a), but it is byrro means
clear that Tacitus means here to dis·
tinguish them, still less that they are
actually distinct (see note there, and
Introd. p. 28). The attempta to find
a Prusso·Lithuanian goddess to corre·
spond seem to be visionary, uor do the
authorities whomTacitus followsappear
to rest their identification on more than
the wearing ol figures of the boar by
the votaries; such figures being w'orn
as amuleta by the priests and wor-
shippers of the ‘magua mater' iu Rome.
The boar was otherwise a German
symbol (see on c. 7, 3), aud regarded
as typical oi courage.
