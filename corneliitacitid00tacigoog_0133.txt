under a name given by Germans and
denoting ‘ settlers.'

continuantur, middle, ‘join on to.'

1. quod femina dominatur. This
is thought by Mf. to have been a fable
founded on the fact that these Finns
distinguished themselves from the high·
land Lapps as ‘kainulaiset’ (a Finnish
word ior ‘Lowlander’), in which was
thought to lie a root of the Gothic
‘quino’ or ‘quens' English ‘quean’
(γυνή), whence arose legends of a
‘evena land' or ‘terra seminarum' in
the north, like the tales of Scythic
Amazona.

intantum, ‘to such an extent'

2. a servitute degenerant, ‘fall
beloy even slavery’ (of the ordinary
type.

3. Hie Suebiae finis: cp. c. 38,1.
Some would transpose these words, as
well as the preceding, to the end of c.
44, but they seem required here to point
the contrast to the names which follow.

Peucinorum. These took their
name from an island belonging to the
delta of the Danube. They are identified
by Tacitus with the Bastarnae (see
befalrylw), but are more properly a division
o t em.

venedorum. Some retain ‘Vene-
torum‚’ thinking that Tacitus may have
confused the name with that of the
Gallic (Caes. 3. 8, 1) or Adriatic (Polyb.
2. 17, 5) Veneti. The right name is
clearly ‘ Venedae,’ or‘ Venedi’ (Plin. 4
13, 27, 97; Ptol. 3. 5, 19), answering
to the ‘Winiclae' of lornandes. Ptol.
also gives their name to some moun-
tains and a guli not easy to identisy.

of that race known to Romans only
through German information, and then
probably living from the east of the
Vistula to the sources of the Bory-
sthenes, in aud round Poland.

4 Fennorum. These are mentioned
by no earlier writer, and are the Φίννοι
of Ptol. 3. 5, ao, the Finns of the main-
land north of the Aestii, extending from
the Baltic to the Ural mountains. The
name again is German, not national
(derived by Zeuss from the Gothic
‘fani’ ‘fen,’ by Mf. from ‘finna'=
‘pinna' in reference to their use of
snowshoes). It is thought that these
Fenni correspond more in description
to the Lappa (see notes below) ; the true
Finns being the Sitones of c. 45, 9.

Sarmatia, not here used with the
attinentiis.niihil lt
northwards. The Sarmatians of this
tract must have been at least in great
part Slavonian (see Introd. p.15, note 6l.

5. quamquam, qualifying the doubt
as regards the first named.

Bastarnas, a widespread name
with many subdivisions (Strab. 7. 3, 15,
305 foll.) extending from the sources of
the Vistula to the mouth of the Danube,
ancl forming one of Pliny's five generic
names (see on c. 2, 3). They are gener-
ally reckoned as true Germana, and as
the first of the race mentioned in
history, having been invited by Philip
of Macedon to aid him against the
Romans in rac. 179 (Liv. 40. 57).

sermone. Their language was
somewhat known to Romaus3 of that
of the Venedi and Fenni Tacitus knows

ln later times ‘Wend' is a German and says nothing.

designation (thought to mean ‘men of
the pastures,' nomads) for the Slavic
tribes generally, and is no more pro·
perly a national name than ‘Vl'elshmen‚'
so that we have probably here a people

6. cultu: cp. a 31, 43 43,1.

aede aa domiciliis, ‘mode of settle·
ment and building houses’: i.e. in
having fixed dwelliugs (see ς 2): ‘agunt’
asin c. 29, 3.
