ized as deeply recessed and containing islands of vast magnitude²;
while the land is spoken of as taking at a certain point a great bend
northward ³. In indicating no other natural boundary eastward than
the Carpathians⁴ he is more consistent with his own conception of
the extent ol Germany in that direction than he would have been if
he had followed Mela and Pliny in drawing the linc at the Vistula ⁵.

He is satisfied to distinguish the vast area included within these
limits into two main portions, the moist plains of the north and
north-west, and the forest and mountain tract of the south and south·
eastt. Of the rivers by which it is intersected‚ he specifies only the
Elbe (and that incorrectly 7); of the forests he notices only the
Hercynian ⁸, and both these apparently sor special reasons ⁹. His
work, in short, stands in no comparison with professed geographica!
treatises, and he 'cannot be assumed to be ignorant of all that he has
not mentioned ¹⁰. .

His mapping out of the country among the several tribes is

marked by much of his general vagueneSS, and would probably have ’

been sar clearer if rivers and other natural features had been taken
more account os. Sometimes definiteness is given by the mention
ol the Rhine or Danube, the ocean, ora mountain tract ¹¹, very often
the position os this or that people is given only relatively to that
of others, as ‘a fronte,' ‘a terg0‚’ ‘a latere ¹²,’ and is more and more
vaguely indicated, as is but natural, the more he recedes from the
frontier. We have, however, certainly no earlier extant account in
