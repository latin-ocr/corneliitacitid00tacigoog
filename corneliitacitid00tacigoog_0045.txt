so-called matriarchal system is not untraceable ¹, but the state of
society as awhole has far outgrown them. The mixed idea given
us of the host in battle, with its picked national troops, its ‘cuneus'
ol free families, its groups ol ‘comites' attendant on the ‘principes ²2
suggests again a possibility that one form of this organization may
have been prominent with some and another with others⁸. Most
Ιο1 all may this be true ol their village life and land system. The ,
'possession of lands by village communities in some form is sar too
widespread and manifold to be a characteristic ol any people ⁴, and·
often seems to adapt itseli to some preexistent institutions or to
survive in some ways or reassert itself where it has been more or less
departed from, or otherwise to take different lorms. It isat least
clear in Germany that we have the village as a subdivision oi the
‘pagus' and that it regulated in some way the occupatiori of the land
comprised in it ⁶. The chiel description that we haveymighttin most
points [approach to a description of a free village under the ‘Marh'
system ⁶. Yet it would be bold to say that permanent individual
ι possession ol land finds no place in the statement ⁷, or that there
· might not have been cases in which the whole village was a cluster
- of dependents ona common lord⁸‚ or that other intermediate forms
. oi tenure may not have been in existence. Great movements‚ such
³ as those which launched the Teutonie tribes against the decaying
Roman empne, would lead naturally to great changes in these
matters ⁹, and it is more remarkable that so much of the account
given in this treatise should be recognizable than that so much should
have passed away.
