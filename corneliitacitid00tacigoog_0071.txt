At Rome the divination might be re-

1. auspiciorum, &c., ‘the confirma-
tion (cp. ‘dictis fides exstitit,' Liv. 10.
34,14) os auspices ‘is yet further (cp.
c. 19, 3; 29, 3) demanded' (c. 14, 4).

2. etiam hio notum, generally taken
to mean ‘is also known in Rome,’ in
contrast to ‘proprium gentis’; but as
Tacitus would hardly state so obvious
a fact, it is probable that ‘hic’ means
‘in Germauy,’ aud is used (asin c. 3, 3)
because ‘illud' had immediately pre-
ceded. The antithesis in thought would
still remain: ‘it is known among them
also how to divine lrom birds, but their
distinctive practice is,’ &e “

3. proprium gentis. It wasa pa-
rently also known to Aryanspealiing
peoples in the east; as Hdt. describes
similar sacred white horses among the
Persians (1.189,1; 7. 40, 5), andan
augury from neighing (3. 86, 1).

4. isdem, those mentioned above
(1.9, 3); local abl. as ‘isdem castris’
(Agr. 15,1), ‘isdem hibernis' (H. 1.
55, 3), and many other analogous ex·
pressions, mainly derived srom poets.

5. et nullo, rather stronger than
‘neque ullo’: cp. c. 20, 5; 28,1,&c.

mortali, ‘human’: cp. c. 21, 23
Agr. 11, r,&c.

contacti, ‘defiled’; so '‘nullis con·
tacta vitiis pectora' (Dial. 12, 1).

pressos, ‘yoked'; so (with ‘iugo ’)
in Ovid (Met. 1, 124; 12, 77, &c.).

6. princeps civitatis. This expres·
sion, like ‘sacerdos civitatis’ above,
seems not merely equivalent to ‘princi-
pum aliqnis,' but to denote some one

person answering to the king 11 king-
less states, as also a ‘princeps Chatto-
rnm' (see note on Introd. p. 19) seems
spoken ol as if he was one, and not
merely one ol many; but the authority
of Caesar, borne out by much later evi-
dence also (see on Introd. p. 20, note 1),
would go to show that many such
states had no single ruler in peace time.
It has been thought that the ‘prinoeps'
oi the most prominent ‘pagus’ bad
some preeminence3 itis possible also
that iu many states constant war with
Rome, or the sear ol it, had made the
‘dux’ (c. 7, 1) more permanent; pos-
sibly also, in states normally under
kings, where no fit person of such com-
manding lineage as to deservo the title
(see c. 7, 1) existed, a ‘Fiirst’ was
sometimes chosen instead from some
wider area, differing lrom him in little
but title. We have again ‘rex vel
princeps' in c. 11, 5, and it seems prob
able that ‘princeps’ is used for the
ruler ol the state inc. 5,4;15,2; 22, 3.

a good omen is they neighed, and a bad

8. sed, inserted by most edd, as Taci-
tus, though he often, alter ‘non solum ’ or
‘non modo,’ omits either ‘sed’ (A. 3.
19, 1811.)11“111111’(,Α.1.6ο,1,811),
never elsewhere omits both. Il, how·
ever, the reading ‘apud sacerdotes’ be
retained, the emphatic climax makes
the omission more tolerable.
