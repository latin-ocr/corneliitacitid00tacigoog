‘cetera intecti' of c. 17,1‚ but would
be taken literally, or nearly so, is heis
following Mela 5. 3 (‘ nudi agunt ante-
quam puberes sunt: viri sagis velantur'),
or perhaps as in c. 6, 2.

sordidi. Their persons, though
washed (c. 22, 1), were unkempt as
compared with Romans. K. takes both
words of clothing Cheli-clad and in
ra .

{sod . . . haee, explained by ‘ qnae mi·
ramur? They were often seen, whether
as slaves or soldiers, at Rome : cp. ‘pro-
cera membra’ (A. 1. 64, 3l, and other
such expressions in H. 5. 18, 13 Caes.
1.3 ,1.

1.9 excrescunt, ‘they grow out ': cp.

‘extrahunt' (c. 22, 1).
ψ 2. nec ancillis, διε.. in strong con-
nast to the habits of fashionable ladies
at Rome, who had abandoned the old
Roman practice of personal nurture and
supervision of children (see Dial. 28, 45
29,1; Agr. 4, 2, δια).

delegantur, sc. ‘infantes' (change
of subject asin c.18, 4). The same
expression is used in Dial. 29‚1 (‘at
nunc natus infans delegatur Graeculae
alicui ancillae ’), and the word is a strong
one (c. 15, 1).

3. servum. Itis here admitted that
there were slaves in the house: see c.
2 5, 1, and note.

educationis deliciis, ‘luxuries of
nurture': cp. ‘infantiam deliciis solvi· “

.- mus' (Quint. 1. 2, 6). It is noted that

this community of child life mitigated
the condition of slavery. The wife
herself was in a way bought (c. 18, ι),
the children were ‘in manu patris.’

4. pecora. These were under thesame
root in the homestead.

(c. 13, ·1.

5. adgnoscat, ‘ marks them as free ’;
a personification to s'gnify that the free
show themselves the better men.
atitali...atttratlltlttl
purity of life. Cp. Mela 3. 3, 26 (‘ lon-
gissima apud eos pueritia est').

inexhausta: cp. H. 5. 7, 43 Verg.
Aen. 10, 174; probably not earlier in
prose.

6. festinantur, often so used pas·
sively (as A. 6. 50, 6), or in the active
transitively (as A. 1. 6, 4) by Tacitus,
as also by poets and Sallust. Here itis
a bold expression for ‘festinanter collo·
cantur’ (‘their marriage is not hurried ’'y.
It appears that German females were
then considered marriageable at the age
of fifteen, but even this stands in con·
trast to the contemporary Roman cus·
tom, in which girls were constantly be·
trothed in infancy‚ aud married at the
age of twelve or even earlier. See
Friedl'ander‚ Sittengeschiehte, i. pp.414‚

504, foll. Later laws would show that '

marriage at twelve years old became
afterwards permissi ble in Germany.
iuventa, ‘youthful vigour.’

7. parea validaeque, ‘pariter va-
lidae virgines miscentur,‘ sc ‘iuveni-
bus?

8. referunt, ‘repeat’: cp. c. 43,1;
also ‘invalidique patrum referant ieiu-
nia nati' (Verg. G. 3, 128).

sororum filiis, &a Among seve
ral peoples of Aryan speech (see ὅςῆ),
in case of the death of a father, theson
acquired ‘tutela' over his sisters, if uu·
married, and thus stood in a very close
relation to their whole life, as shown
by his Roman title, in respect to.their
