THE ACCOUNT GIVEN ΒΥ TACITUS 31

The picture is not indeed wholly without its other side, when the
candour of the historiari asserts itself against the desire to idealize.
Itis admitted that their independence is even excessive ¹, that they ⁶
are torn to pieces by internal feuds¹, impulsive and unsteady in
battle ³, indolent and quarrelsome in peace ⁴, predatory⁵, drunlren¹¹‚
⁸ absorbed by the passion for gambling⁷; in fact that their finer
qualities are by no means without thevices which in a low state of
civilization are apt to go with them.

In attempting to gather the description of the country and its
people into generalizations, we are often baffled by difficulties probably
due to unexplained diversity. The discrepancies between Caesar and
Tacitus, or those between Tacitus and himself, or between either of
them and the earliest later knowledge, may often arise from the
different stages of civilization of different tribes and from the attempt

¹ to disguise variations under a condensed general statement. Some-

times distinctions are drawn, but they may have been oftener omitted
where they exist. We are told, for instance, that royalty had its
gradeS, from the most despotic to the most limited⁸3 it was perhaps
no less true that-there were free states with and without permanent ,
chief magistrates ¹. Wandering life, sustained by floclrs and herds‚
would hardly have given way everywhere to settled dwellings and
agriculture in the 150 years, between Caesar and Tacitus if it had
not been aheady partial and on the wane at the time of the former¹⁰ 3 .
hunting, though it may have declined, could hardly at the earlier
date have been a general pursuit, except among a certain class· and
in favourable districts ¹¹3 in religion, Caesar may have given us the
lowest and most popular, Tacitus the more advanced conception of
divinity¹¹.

It is perhaps for the same reason that our descriptions often give
us traces of an institution complicated or crossed by something
different¹³. Patriarchal government has still its survivals¹⁴, and the
family tie is still of extreme importance 15; even the more primitive
