1. haec . . . tona (sc. ‘virilis ⁹). Taci-

ipso concilio’ above) with the Roman
private ceremonias of the ‘tirocinium‘

‘deductio in fornm’

ante hoe, &ct it was in fact an
act of emancipation ‘ e mann patris,’ but
' probably the fnll rights of a freeman
were confined to landholders. The Ro·
man ‘toga virilis' gave no emancipatiou.
, 3. insignia nobilitas, &a The
reading and interpretation of this pas·
sage are much disputed. As regards
this sentence, ‘dignitatem‘ has good
MS. authority, but ‘dignationem' is
very generally read. The latter word
has always elsewhere in Tacitus, and
also in most other authors, much the
same force as the former, and denotes
a person’s rank or position, or the con-
sideration in which he is held: cp. c.
26, 13 ‘inponere imperatoris digna·
tionem’ (H. r. 52, 7), &c The mean-
ing would thus be ‘distinguished rank
or great services of parents award to
some even as stri liugs (stronger than
‘iuvenem'above)thepositionofaprince’
(cp. ‘imperium adsignabunt,’ H. 1. 30,
7). The difficulty of connecting the
sentence thus interpreted with the fol-
lowing words (see note below), added
to that of supposing that ‘adolescentuli’
could become ‘principes' in any such
sense as that given above (ξ 1), has led
others to take ‘principis dignationem’
to mean ‘the esteem, or approval of
a prince,' i.e. that on such grounds a
prince sometimes selects even stripllngs,
whom he himself invests with arms (see
above), and whom he at once enrols
among his ‘comites' This sense of
‘dignati0,' though otherwise foreign to
Tacitus, seems borne out by such pas·

sages as ‘tanta dignatione dilexit' (Suet.
Cal. 24), ‘in summa dignatione regis
vixit'(Just. 3. 28, 10), and certainly
makes the whole passage much clearer,
though we should perhaps expect some .
other verb than ‘ adsignant,’ in the sense
of ‘bespeak‘

4. ceteris, &c With the interpre· '
tation preferred above, this would
mean that those whom the ‘princeps'
honours even as striplings with admis-
sion to his ‘comitatus are grouped
with the older members of it, and are
not ashamed, in spite of their high pa·
rentage, to serve in its rank and file.
Those who take the other interpretation
of ‘ principis dignationem ’ would either
explain these words as meaning that
the ‘adolescentuli,’ though already
ranked as ‘principes’ are not at once
actual leaders, but serve for a time in
the ranks (a meaning hard to get out
of the words), or would (as Halm, Mn,
Pramm. and others) adopt Lipsius'
reading ‘ceteri’ with the meaning that
thos'e ‘tirones’ who were not so ex-
ceptionally ranked as ‘principes' ‘are
grouped with riper and tried warriors.'
join themselves to the ‘comitatus' of
some chief. But we should rather sup·
pose that those invested with arms by
the parent or guardian were enrolled in
the ‘cuneus’ of the family or clan (c.
7, 3). Several other alterations of the
text have been suggested.

5. neo rubor: ‘necrubori,' poet. for
‘nec dedecus': cp. ‘nec rubor est emisse’
(Ov. A. A. 3, 167), and Peterson's note
on Dial. 37,1. This sentence supports
the reading ‘ceteris' as it would most
naturally refer to persons of high birth.
If ‘ceteri’ be read, there would be here
no special reference to the ‘ adolescen-
tuli: but a general remark, with an im·
plied contrast to the position of a client
at Rome, so often described as humiliat·
ing. The subject of the ‘comitatus'
extends to the end of c. 14.
