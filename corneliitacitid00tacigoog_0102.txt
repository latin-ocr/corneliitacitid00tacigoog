names, as Batavodurum (H. 4. 20, 3)
and Lugdunum (Leyden), and they

34bbbos, explained by the more speeifie
words following. The expression would
show thar, after their rising with Civilis
in Α. 1). 69-70 (oi which nothing is here
said), they had submitted on hononrable
terms3 bnt their troops appear to have
been no longer kept together, or under

sen, l. l. p. 144).

4. nam neo, &c., ‘for they are neither
insulted by tribute, nor ground down by

in their country in A.D. 47 (A. 11. 20,
4). They joined Civilis (H. 4. 37, 4)
but had now returned to their allegiance,
and from this time are permanently
incorporated as the ‘civitas Mattia-
corum Taunensium’ (see Mommsen, l. l.
11111 wilini. 1111111 hilii
(A. 1. 56, 6), and are mentioned here
