elemental thundcrgod, as much less than Zeus as Wuodan is more.
than Hermes or by Tru or Ziu2, who, however he may have been
conceived originally, is known later specially as the war-god, even in
this capacity not more such than Wuodan, and retaining little or
nothing of Zeus but the bare name. Another competitor for supremacy
‘ may have been Freyr, the god of fertility‚ who seems to have been
the chief object of worship 'with one section of Germans ⁸, but of whom
Tacitus knows nothing. From the ways in which these conceptions
of deities cross each other, and from the passages in Tacitus where ‚
a single divine ancestor of the race⁴ and ruler of all things⁵ is spoken
of, we seem to recognize a general and perhaps undefined idea of
divinity passing into a mythology adapting itself to the prevalent
worships of different divisions of the race ⁶, and tending to centre in
the supreme god ofa dominam section. ln some similar fashion the
mysterious goddesses mentioned in three different places⁷ may all be Ι
brought into harmony with each other and with the theology as
a whole by being regarded as various local forms of the worship of
Earth ⁸, who, besides such attributes as elsewhere attached to her, was

with Germans the special parent of their ancestral god ⁰.

to some to point to his wanderings to the remotest ocean ¹2, is generally
supposed to be found in the hero Irmin, whose personality‚ however,
partakes of the prevalent confusion, whose name appears sometimes
