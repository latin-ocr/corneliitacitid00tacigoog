ingenuos et super nobiles ascendunt: apud ceteros impares

5. in uices B, inuicem b, uices Cc, vice H, vicis Bambergensis, [vices] Halm.

1. impares (sc. ‘ingenuis ') libertini,
equivalent to an abstract noun with
genit. as sabjectto theverb (‘ theinferior
position of freedmen is,' &c.). The con·
stmction is more common with partici-
¹ ples (see Draeger, Synt. und Stil, ξ 210).

a. libertatis, politicalfreedom. Thus
the sense of freedom in the Britons made
them disdain Nero's freedman Polycli-
tus when sent to them (A. 14. 39, 3).

3. Faenus agitare, &a ‘ligitare'
with the sense of ‘exercere’ (‘ to make
a business of ’), is so used with ‘faenus'
inno, 16, 3, and with ‘ fmmenta' ‘vecti-
galia' &c in A. 4 6, 1. For ‘extendere
in,' cp. c. 17, 3. The difficulty lies in the
second clause, which some take in a dis·
tinet sense, and translate‘lendingmoney
on interest and increasingit bycompound
interest' (C. R). But the first clause
would make the second very needless,
and it is perhaps better to take them
(like so many expressions in this treatise)
as virtually synonymous (‘to trade with
capital and makeit run on into interest’).
The evils of Roman practice and a crisis
arising from it are described in A. 6.
16-17. The whole remark is somewhat
unnecessary, in speaking of a nation
who had mostly no money, and dealt
by barter (c. 5, 4).

ideoque,&c. Z. (afterKraffert) alters
this to ‘idqae,’ explained as ‘faenus non
agitare'; the idea of which has other·
wise to be supplied from the sense as
subject of ⁴ servatur? The construction
in either case is awkward, and the sen·
tence seems a weak repetition of what
has been already better said at the end
of c. 19. Thiersch reads ‘ignominiosum’
for ⁴ ignotum,' others bracket the whole,
‘faenus esset‚' or the latter part,
‘ideoque . . . esset‚' as an interpolation.

5. ab universis vicis, ‘by villages
as communitas! This reading, pre·
served in one MS. and probably indi·

Ga

cated by the corruption ‘vices’ (for
which ‘in vices’ and ‘invicem' may be
corrections), is adopted by Z.‚ also by
Waitz and other writers, and gives the
best sense to the passage, which appears
to describe a free village (as contrasted
with that noted-in c. 25, 1). The form -
of such a village community found later
in Germany is that called the mark sys-
tem, on which see Von Maurer, in Sir
H. Maine‚Village Communium, pp. 78-
82. The community as such was pos·
sessed of a tract of land, divided into
three marks or portions; (1) the mark
of the¹ township or village, the ground
tetii,llitnttlttrtiitt
land or pastore mark, held by all in
mixed ownership under supervision3
(3) the arable mark, taken out of the
common for cultivation, divided into
three great fields, of which one lay fal·
low every year. A portion of this mark
was allotted to and cultivated by every
family, subject to fixed rules of cropping
and fallowing. We cannot, indeed, re-
cognize this system as a whole in the
description here given (see following
notes), but we heve perhaps an account
of some state of things out of which it
iilliviai‘irllty,Tiffiialhilliilii
or ‘invicem ¹ (with a reference to ‘arva
mutant’ below) would still make
the land to be occupied ‘ab universis,'
i. e. by communities of men, such as
probably clans or great families (see
Introd. pp. aa, 32). For various other
readings, see Mr.

6. seeundum dignationem, ‘in pro·
portion to their renk’ (cp. c.13‚ a, and
note): apparently implying that the
‘princeps' or ‘nobilis' had more than
the simple freeman. Caesar says (6. aa,
2-4) that they had no private land, and
that, as regardscommon rights,all stood
