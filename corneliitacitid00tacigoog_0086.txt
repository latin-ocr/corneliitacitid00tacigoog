above), or that they became more severe

1. potate, ‘youth'rthe ablativos are

a. invenerit. The subject can be
supplied from the sense.

3. eorrumpere et eorrumpi, so
coupled in Α. 14. 20, 5.

saeculum, ‘the spirit os the age,'
way of the world.

melius, sc. ‘agunt ': verbs os motion
or action, as well as of speaking, are
osten omitted by Tacitus. Cp. Agr.
19, a; ‘vos quidem istud pro me' (H.
r. 841) ‘melius . . . ille' (A. r. 43, ι),
διο. ‘Adhuc’ adds force to the eom·
parative (‘ better still '), as in c. 29, 3,

· and has osten the sense of ‘further'
(cp. c. 10, 3), like ἔτι.

4. in quibus, &o There is later
evidence that among some the widow
was expected to hang herself, or to burn
on the husband's pile, like the lndian
Sume, and that the marriage of widows,

even where not forbidden, was thought ’

dishonourable This is, os course, a
still stronger contrast to Roman custom.

5. spe votoque, ‘the hope and as·

7. ultra beyond one marriage.
ne tamquam, &c., ‘that her love

may be, as it were, not sor the husband,
but lor the married state': that she
should love her husband not merely as
a man, bnt rather as elevating her to
the permanent dignity of a matron.
‘Tamquam' has constantly in Tacitus
the foroe os ὡς, here rather that of ὡς
εἰπεῖν, as qualilying a strong statement.

others omit the second ‘ tamquam)

8. numerum . . . finire, ‘to prevent
an increase' (Jnv. 6, 595).

9. adgnatia = ἐπιγόνοις, children born
after there is already an heir: so in H.
5. 5, 5, where a similar prohibition
among the Jews is mentioned. Tacitus
appears here to overstrain the contrast;
ior it can be shown that the German

ro. morea .· . leges, so opposed in
Hor. Od. 3. 24', 35. The German sanc·
tity of custom is contrasted with the
futility os such laws as the ‘lex Papia
Poppaea’ at Rome (see A. 3. 26, r, foll.).
N 0 written German laws appear to be
certainly traceable earlier than the Salio
os the fifth century.
