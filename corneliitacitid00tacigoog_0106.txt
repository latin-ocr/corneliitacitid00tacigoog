fleetness approaches (so ‘ iuxta ' answers
to ‘propior' in A. 6. 42, 3) timidity.
deliberateness (so in H. 3. 20,1; here
of the movements oi footsoldiers) is
nearer to steadiness! For ‘parare’
Heraeus and Halm read ‘parere (refer-

usurpatum raro, ‘what is a rare
practice' (in appos. with the infinitive
subjecte ‘submittere’ ‘exuere’). For
this use ol the participle as subject

sense only. The point os the ‘audentia'

Gemens usually wore their hair long,
but not wholly unshom, and kept it
in some order (cp. c. 38. a), as cou-
trasted with the ‘squalor' here.

8. votivum. Civilis discharges him-
self os such a vow (H. 4. 61, 1), and
similar instances are given ol later
Saxons and ol the Norseman Harold
Harfagr (SS.). Suet. records a similar
vow taken by Julius Caesar (Suet. Jul.
67) after a disaster.

obligatum virtuti, ‘dedicated (i. e.
by which they had dedicated them-
selves) to valour.’

9. super sanguinem et spolia,
rhetorical, ‘as they stand over the slain
and despoiled enemy!

tum demum, &c., ‘not till then
have they repaid their country and
parents for having reared them np’:
from the Greek phrases θρέπτρα (or
τροφεῖα) ἀποδοῦναι.

11. ignavis et imbellibus, cp. c.
η, 1. The sentence goes with the
preceding, and Tacitus seems not to
have noticed its inconsisteney with what
follows.
