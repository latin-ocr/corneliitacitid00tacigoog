emirantes accipiunt. sucum tamen arborum esse intellegas
quia terrena quaedam atque etiam volucria animalia plerumque
interiacent, quae implicata humore mox durescente materia
¹reluduntur. fecundiora igitur nemora lucosque sicut Orientis5
secretis, ubi tura balsamaque sudantur, ita Occidentis insulis
terrisque inesse crediderim, quae vicini solis radiis expressa
atque liquentia in proximum mare labuntur ac vi tempes-

came only from the Arabian Sabaeans
(Verg. G. 2, 117), and balsam or balm
from Palestine (H. 5. 6, 3).

sudsntur: for the passive cp. ‘suda-
taque ligno tura’ (Ov. M. 1ο, 388).
The alternative ‘sudant' is retained by
some, who take it transitively, as in

are rightly placed here, we must suppose
