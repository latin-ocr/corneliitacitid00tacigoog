tion' (between invited and nninvited):
cp. ‘notum ignotumque‚' &c below.
This indiscriminateness of hospitality
is characteristic of ancient civilization.
and grows out of its circumstances:
without it, travelling would have been
impossible. It can be illustrated abun-
dantly from the Homeric poema, and
from many otber sources, and has its
counterpart now in scantily peopled
countries, though iu strong contrast to
modern society generally, or to the

, Rome of Tacitus·

1. quantum ad, ‘ so far as concems'
(=‘quantnm attinet ad’); so in Agr.
44, 33 H. 5. 10, 33 perhapstaken from
Ov. A. A. 1, 744 t‘quantum ad Piri-
thoum').

2. abeunti. Such gifts to the guest
on departure, and the asking for them,
are illustrated from the Nibelungenlied;
the old German name for them is ‘ letzi '
(SS.). Such ξεινήια are constantly men·
tioned in the Homeric poems.

moris: cp.c.13,1. Ι

3. facilitas, ‘freedom from con·
straint’: so ‘ facilis' is used in the sense
of ‘frank' in Agr. 40, 4; Α. 3. 8, 4,
&c

gaudent, emphatic, asin c. 5, 2.

4. imputant, ‘reckon as a favour.'
The giver expects no return, the receiver
feels no obligation.

sentence could possibly be taken as sum-

seems so weak and out of place that it
has been generally either bracketed or
altered. Some, by reading ‘communis’

for ‘comis' make it a reminiscence of
the ‘victusque communicatnr' of Caes
(see above). The ‘vinculum inter hos·
pites comitas' of Lachmann (which SS.
adopts) is somewhat violent und hardly
apposite; ‘victus inter honestiores co·
mites ⁹ (Mr.) would give a meaning only
true in special caseS, where a ‘comita-
tus'existed, and it is perhaps best to
regard the sentence as interpolatcd from
amarginal summary of the passage.
The preceding sentence seems to close
the subject.

6. quem plerumque, &c.‚ in cou-
trast to the Romans who usually rose
before daybreak.

7. saepius calida. In view os other
statements (as Caes. 4.r,10; 6. 21, 5;
Herodian, 7. 2,12) that the Germans'
bath was the river, and the abundant
evidence of their fondness sor swimming
(A. 2. 8, 3), it has been thought that
Tacitus is wrong; but his words may
well be true os the daily ablutions of
most Germans during most part of the
year (‘ saepius '). For the use of ‘nt,'
cp. c. 17, 2.

plurimum, sc. ‘temporis‘ (c. 15, r).

8. separatae, &e This also is con-
trary to Roman custom. It has been
thought that the latter part of the state-
ment isan error arising from the use of
the same German words for a table and
a dish (cp. ‘Tisch ’ from Latin ‘discus');
but separate rables as well as separate
seats are found used by Greeks in early
times (Od. 17, 333; 22, 74, &c.).

9. convivia3 besides public, there
were osten family feasts to celebrate
births, marriages, &c
