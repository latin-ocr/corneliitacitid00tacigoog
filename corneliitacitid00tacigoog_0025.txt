&c Among writers nearer to'his own time, he seems to have bor-
rowed from Seneca ¹ the somewhat fanciful figure ‘sepulchrum caespes
erigit' (c. 27, 3), perhaps ‘diem disponere' (c. 30, a), ‘crinem
submittere’ (c. 31, 1). ¹

This brief sketch of the style of this treatise would be incomplete

somewhat larger number he appears to follow the ‘Naturalis Historia'
of Pliny ὃ, but seldom without additional details from other sources

likely to have been indebted. The great separate work of Pliny in
twenty Books on all the Roman wars with Germany⁸ may probably
have contained some general account of the Germans and their
customs ; there is evidence that Sallust had written something on the
