76 CORNELII TACITI DE GERMANIA

quam amicitias necesse est; nec inplacabiles durant: luitur
enim etiam homicidium certo armentorum ac pecorum numero
recipitque satisfactionem universa domus, utiliter in publicum,
quia periculosiores sunt inimicitiae iuxta libertatem.

5 Convictibus et hospitiis non alia gens effusius indulget2
quemcumque mortalium arcere tecto nefas habetur; pro for·
tuna quisque apparatis epulis excipit. cum defecere, qui
modo hospes fuerat, monstrator hospitii et comes; proximam
domum non invitati adeunt. nec interest: pari humanitate3

5. aliqua Bb.

1, necesse est 3 it is enforced by
German opinion and moral'sentiment.
With them the sacredness of the family
tie and the promptness to resent inju-
ries were exceptionally strong.

nec . . . durant, ‘nor yet do they
(the feuds) continue irreconcileable.’
The reconciliation of homicide, as the
greatest of feuds (‘ etiam homicidium '),
implies that of those rising from lesser
causes.

luitur, &c Itis thought by some
that the acceptance of this satisfaction
was not compulsory upon the relatives
of the slain; and it appears not to have
always ended the fend tsee note below).
The principle, however. prevails in some
form almost as generally as that of
blood vengeance itself. Instances may
be seen in the Homeric poems, as in Il.
9. 632, soll, and the ποινὴ ἀνδρὸς ἀπο-
φθιμένου ofIl. 18. 498. ln old German
laws the compensation fine is called
‘w'e'rageld,' ‘werigeltf or ‘we'rgeld,'
and is assessed by a regular code ac·
cording to the rank of the slain person
(see Kemble‚ ch. x). For the payment
of fines in cattle, cp. c. 12, 2.

3. universa domus. All members
of the family became parties to the com·
pact to drop the feud. Laws are found
imposing penalties for persistence in it
after compensation. ⁴ Satisfactionem ac·
cepit' is found ln Caes. 6. 9, 8.

5. Convictibus et hospitiis, ‘en-
tertainments and hospitalities‚' feasts to
each other, and reception of strangers.
The previous subject leads Tacitus to

responsible for the sale conduct of the
stranger to the next house. The hos-

itality of the Germana is noted in simi·
lar terms by Caesar (6. 2 3, pl: ‘hospitem
violare fas non putant; qni quaque de
cansa ad eos venerint, ab iniuria pro·
