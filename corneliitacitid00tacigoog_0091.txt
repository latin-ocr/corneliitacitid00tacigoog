3. sed de C c, text Bb.

8. ad 1111 Β, adhec b, ad hnc C, ad hoc S, text c.

9. loci mu'uusandmps. ,

1. armati: see c. 11, 43 13,1.

diem noctemque continuare, ‘to
spend the whole day and night'3 so
in A. 16. 5, 1. In A. 11. 1o,4, 1 Ger-
man prince is described as ‘saepius vino·
lentiam ac libidines, grata barbaris, usur·
pans.' It would be implied that at
Rome drnnkennesS, however common,
was not equally uncondemned.

2. ut, sc. ‘fieri solet‘: cp. 1. a,4

3. caede. SS. notes the srequeney 01
this as attested by a Salio law holding
the surviving members 01 the feast re·
sponsible in such cases.

transiguntur, ‘are settled)

4. invicem: ‘ inter se’; so ‘miscere
invicem consilia’ (Agr. 38,1)‚&c. Some

would take it adversatively, asin c. 21,'

3, &c The custom 01 sealing the re·
⁸ conciliation 01 a qnarrel by drinking
110111 the same cup is noted as a survival.

adfinitatibus, ‘family alliances,'
such as those of marriage.

5. principibus, perhaps here ‘duci-
bus’ (c. 7,1):cp.‘rex . . .adscisce·
retur' (Α.11. 10, 4).

de . . . bello. The rising of Civilis
(H. 414, 3) and that against Varus
(A. 1. 55, 3) were thus projected at
leasts, and a similar ancient Greek cus·
tom is seen in Hom. Il. 9, 89, 1011, &c
Bp. Stubbs notes (p. 30) that these
ieasts are a real purt 01 the ‘concilium'
(c.11,12),and have their counterpart
iu later times.

6. tamquam, assiguing the supposed
reason, as in c. 12, 2, &c

7. simplices, ἁπλοῦς, ‘unreserved’ ;

so ‘simplicissime loquimur' (H.1. 15,8);
‘convivaliumfabularum simplicitas’ (A.
6. 5, 1). Κ. takes it in a sense opposed
to ‘magnas,' 11 ‘readily understood,'
such as ‘ reconciliandis inimicis,’ in con-
trast to ‘de bello,' &c

8. non astuta nec callida, ‘with-
out natnral or acquired cunning,' C. Β.

aperit adhuc, ‘still continues (cp.
c. 3, 3, &c.) to discluse,’ in contrast to
Romans, who had learnt reticence eveu
in their cups (cp. Agr. 2, 3). Some
take ‘adhuc’ with ‘secreta,' bnt it ap·
pears to go more commonly with the
preceding word.

9. ergo . . . mens, so stopped by
Halm and Z., giving ‘ergo' its 10111 11
summing up the preceding words. K.
and SS. omit the stop, and 11111 ‘mens,'
somewhat boldly, in the sense 01 ‘con-
silium' as subject os ‘retractatur' ; to
which, with the other stopping, some
such general subject as ‘res' must be
supplied 110111 the sense. Some (with
Meiseryread ⁸ res retractatur!

postera die, &a Herodotus de·
1111111111. 133, 5) a similar practice
among the ancient Persians.

10. salva . . ‚ratio 111, ‘the regard
paid to either time (advantage accruing
from it) is secured ⁹ z ‘ratio' seems here
nscd in a sense akin to the expressions
‘meaa' ‘tuae rationes’ (Cic. and Sall.):
cp. ‘ cui . . . ratio luit' (H. 3. 11, 1).

11. dum=‘tnm cums

constituunt, &c., ‘they decide when
they cannot be misled' (carried away
by excitement). The obvious exaggera·
