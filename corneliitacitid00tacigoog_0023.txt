10 INTRODUCTJON

characteristic corresponding gerundive genitive¹ is wholly absent, as

listeners Thus what is called ‘anaphora' or the repetition sor ,

emphasis of an adjective, pronoun, adverb, &c., is especially fre-
quent⁴: frequent also is a general redundancy ol expression, some-
times in the lorm ol pleonasm, as ‘initium incohatur' (2. 3ο, 1), much
ostener by combination ol nearly is not quite synonymous expres-
siom‘, as ‘recenset nuper additum' (2. 2, 5), ‘propriam et sinceram
et sui similem' (2. 4, 1), ‘laboris atque operum' (2. 4, 3), ‘lucos ac
nemora' (2. 9, 3), ‘temere ac fortuito’ (2.1ο, 1), ‘constituunt . . .
condicunt’ (2.11, 2), ‘ignavos et inbelles’ (2.12, 1), ‘infame . . .
probrosum' (2. 14. 2), ‘defendere tueri’ (112), ‘pace et otio' (c. 14.
3), ‘pigrum et iuers' (2. 14, 5), ‘discreti ac diversi’(c. 16, 2), ‘ex-
tremo ac novissimo' (2. 24, 3), ‘dolorem et tristitiam’ (2. 27, 2),
‘sede finibusque . . . mente animoque' (2. 29, 3), ‘raptibus aut

‘vis et potentia' (2. 42, 2), ‘rude . . . informe’ (2. 45, 5). Some-
times rhetorical point is given by alliteration, as ‘mutuo metu aut
montibus’ (2. 1, 1), ‘terrent trepidantve’ (2. 3, 1), ‘sudore . . . san-
guine’ (2. 14, 5), ‘pace. . . proelio’ (c.18,3), ‘lamenta et lacrimas’

’ 4), ‘proeliis ac periclitando' (242, 1); sometimes a more poetical
