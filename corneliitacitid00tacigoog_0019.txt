a substantive work, and enlarge it to its present dimensions.

Nor are we wholly without grounds of conjecture as to his possible
reasons for working it up to completion and publishing it at this parti-

thoroughness‚ the defensive policy which had succeeded to the cam-
paigns of Domitian, and which had evidently commended itself to his
own jurgement2. Terms were made with nations on the spot, the
frontier all along was carefully laid out and strengthened by colonies

overwhelming numbers of the tribes of Germany, the climatic, phy·
