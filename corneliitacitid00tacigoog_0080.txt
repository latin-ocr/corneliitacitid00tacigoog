1. electi, better than their own
usually were (c. 6, 3).
magna arma Some would read

‘magnifica' or even ‘insignia ’ ; but it is
easy to take it to mean massive shields
and cuirasses, suitable to their stature,
possibly also huge offensive weapous,
as spears and swords.

phalerae . . . torques. These em-
bossed platesor dises and collars are
often mentioned as military decorations

os Roman soldiers (Juv. 16, 60, &c.).

iamet. . . docuimus, ‘we have now
even taught them' (cp. c. 42, 1), as
a lesson 01 Roman avarice.

pecuniam. He is not here speaking
os trade, as in c. 5, 5, but os bribes to
princes in Roman interest, as spoken 01
1110.41,1; A.11.16,3: cp. ‘pecuniam
et dona, quis solis corrumpantur‘ (H.
4. 76, 3). It has been thought that
some such action on the part os
Domitian may be here alluded tn.

3. populis, dat. 01 agent, asin c. 31,

1, &e‘

urbes: see lntrod. p. 24.

' 4. colunt, &o It is generally sup-
posed that Tacitus means in this
passage to speak 01 two modes 01
dwelling. the single houses altogether
separate, and the villages 01 houses still
detached but more or less closely
grouped. There is reason to think that
there were at this time two classes 01
villages, the dependent (c. 25, 1 and
note) and the free (c. 16, 1 and note),
and it is possible that what he speaks os
first is in fact the former, but that the
house 01 the lord, built where he chose,
is alone mentioned (the buts 01 the serss
being sufficiently insignificant to be
ignored>, and that he then goes on to

speak 01 the more important or free
villages, which alone he would probably
reckon as ‘ vici! It would seem that all
houses belonged in some sense to ‘ vici'
as centres 01 justice (c. 11, 3).

disoreti ao diversi, ‘separated and
in various places’: cp. ‘si . .. diversi
inrupissent’ (H. 3. 46, 3).

5. ut fons, &c SS. notices the
irequeucy in German names 01 such
terminations as ‘brunnen,’ ‘feld' ‘berg‚'
‘wald‚’&c.

vicos looant. ‘they lay out their
villages? The description here given
would marka social stage far above
that 01 Caesar’s time, who makes the
Germane (6. 11, 1) have no fixed
dwellings at all (see on c. 16, 1). The
account 01 Caesar was perhaps even
then true only 01 some tribes 01 more
wandering 111 . He is thought to have
known most 01 the Suebi (see on c. 38,
1), whom he describes separately (4.
1—4).

7. spatio, ‘a homestead,' garden,
χορτός, ‘ hortus,' surrounded by a fence.

8. remedium, in appositiou with the
sentence.

inscitia (causal abl), so with
genit. in Agr. 28‚4, &c A far more
probable reason than either os these is
to be found in the German love 01
independence. From these words he is
led to speak 01 their mode 01 building.

caementorum . . . tegularum. This
is confirmed by the absence 01 genuine
German names sor these and the use 01
words 01 Latin origin, as ‘ cement' and
‘tile’ (‘ Ziegel ’). The primitive roos
would be 01 straw or rushes, as was that
01 the Gauls (Caes. 5. 43, 1). ‘Cae-
meuta,' rough stone (opp. to ‘ materia ’).
