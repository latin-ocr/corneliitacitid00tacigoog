30 ' INTRODUCTION

in some respects above the king. To him belongs, as 'a sacred duty,
the maintenance· of order in the assemblies, and the coercion of

aThersites¹‚ to him alone the infliction os capital or other punish-

ment, as executing the sentence oia god for a breach of religion, on -

those guilty of misconduct in wari. Their ritual bears the marks
of great antiquity; human sacrifice finding place in it at stated times '
in peace ⁸, and as a kind of sanctified massacre in war⁴; while their
most characteristic mode of divination recalls that of the ancient
Persians⁶. Side by side with the regular modes of divination is the

countrywomenl, especially, as it would seem, at the gravest criseS‚ ,

sanctuary ⁸. ’

magistrate ⁹, who do not deify mortals ¹⁰, bury their dead without

pomp ¹1, have never heard of usury¹², care no more for silver plate

who have no hireling gladiators to amuse them, but only the spear-
dance of the lrce¹⁵‚ among whom the dowered wile, and all her
intrigues, her love-letters, her corruption by licentious plays and

unchastity, il not wholly unknown, rare and terribly avenged ¹⁷, where
insants are neither exposed to die nor neglected and lest to foster·
nurses¹⁸, but reared up to a youth of hardihood, uselulnesS, and
purity ¹⁹, where there is no gang of domestics with multifarious
fonctions, but the slave has generally a household of his own, nor
lives in constant fear of stripes and death ²⁰, where the childless old
man wields no social tyranny, and is surrounded by no cloud os
legacy·hnnters²'.
