THE ACCOUNT GIVEN ΒΥ TACITUS 23

It is only in a few sentences that we learn anything 01 the aggre-
gate 01 ‘vici' forming the ‘pagus ¹,' represented to us as also ajudicial
centre, and as turnishing its hundred jurors to the court ¹, and its
hundred picked warriors to the host ³. It is most commonly identi-
fied with the German ‘Gau’ or English ‘shire ⁴‚’ but, 11 s0, apparently
with earlier and smaller divisions under such names than those which
are historically best known to us ⁶. There is much probability in the
view that the ‘pagus '. was really the ‘hundred ⁶,’ known to us later
as the chief centre 01 judicial administration whether crimina] 01
civil under its presiding ‘ealdorman' and jurors⁷. The ‘hundred'
, as well as the village, was probably at first an aggregate 01 persons
or families rather than 01 territorial districts ⁸, and had lost its
numerical significance besore we have authentic record 01 11⁹. '

province, or to the English shire as later understood 10; the only
