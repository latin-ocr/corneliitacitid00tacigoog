1. servis: German slaves generally
had close cropped hair.

3. rarum, sc. ‘est,’ ‘the practice
(⁴ obliquare crinem nodoque substrin-
gere ’) exists‚ but is rare, and confined
to youth? What was really character-
istic of the Suebi was its universality,
among all free men and at every time
of life. Some stop differently, so as to

, take ‘rarum' as in apposition with

‘retorquent’ The causal ablatives ‘cog-
natione' and ‘imitatione' give reasons
not for the practice being rare, but for
its existence elsewhere at all.

4. horrentem, ‘unkempt’

retorquam Halm, Mu, and Z. thus
follow Madvig. Some such meaning is
required, and it hardly seems possible
to extract it, even under a figure of
rhetoric, from ‘retro sequuntur, which
is uo true equivalent to the ‘capillos . ..
retro agere' of Quint. 11. 3, 160.

ao saepe, &c The text (see crit.
note) has been very variously treated.
It seems best (with Halm, Mr., Pramm.‚
Z.) to treat ‘solo’ as a gloss ou ‘ipso'
Those who retain both words generally
take ‘solo‘ with the force ol ‘solum‚'
to which others would alter it. For
other readings aud interpretations see
38⁹. Some also read, with the best
MSS, ‘religatur.' It is in any case
plain that Tacitus means here to
describe a different and exceptional
mode, that of those who, instead of
knotting the hair at the back of the
neck (cp. ‘nodo substringere '), gather
it up ou the top of the head. The
Marcomani and Quadi represented on

the Antonine column show neith'er
mode, but have wild and unkempt hair;
but figures with the hair gathered into
such a knot on the crown as is here
described are found ou the column of
Trajan, and are taken by Fabretti
(Syntagma, p. 16) to be possibly Suebic
auxiliaries

5. principes, &c., ‘their chief men
(kings aud nobles) wear their hair yet
more omately,’ adding artificial height
to the structure. Such a custom is
found among the princes of the F rauks,
Goths, and Vandals. Cp. the descrip-
tion in Sid. Apoll. of Theodoric:
‘ capitis apex rotundus, in quo paululum
a planitie frontis in verticem caesaries
refuga crispatur.’ The following words
referto these only; the simple knot of
ordinary men, as seen in the figures
above referred to, being too small for
anbflbfbwzmurgaeffbcfmae. ‘in this point
they care for their personal appearance.’

innoxia, explained by the following
words.

7. in altitudinem, &cz the asyn-
deton is adversative, and the prep.
expresses result, as in c. 24, 2, &c ‘Et k,
terrorem' is explanatory ‘to add to ,
the height and strike terror ). '

comptius. This emendation seems
much better than bracketing‘ut’ They
wear inore adommeut for the eyes of
their enemies, not (as Romans) for
those of the lover or mistress. Cicero
(Cata. 10, aa) describes such young
Romans, ‘pexo capillo nitidos, and
their mode of life.
