jan became Cos. ΙΙ., with Nerva, Cos
lv. on Jan. 1, Ab. 98; and became
emperor on the death of the latter,
Jan. 25. The reckoning is important
as fixing the date of this book.

1. ducenti ferme, strictly 210 years.

colliguntur, ‘ are summed up’; so
‘centum et viginti anni. . . colliguntur’
(Dial. 17, 3).

tam diu Germania vincitur. The
last word is ironical, ‘so long takes
our (so-called) conquest of Germany,’
a phrase perhaps in the mouths of
the Roman war party (see introd.
p. 6) ε ep. § 6 (⁴ triumphati magis quam
victi').

a. multa in vicem damna, sc.
‘fuere’: ‘in vicem‘ has the force of an
attributive adjective· (¹ mutua '): ep.
ditthltttiitt dii? ii: {i}

3. Samnis, &e ln such enumera-
tions Tacitus varies the wording, as
here by change from sing. to pl. and ⁴
from peoples to countries and back
aarn.
g4 admonuere, ‘have given as a
warning’ (by disaster) ; cp. ‘actos dolor
admonet annos' (Tibull. 4. 1, 189).

regno Arsacia ‘the Arsacid despot-
ism.' The kingdom and empire of the
Parthians was founded by ArsaceS, eir.
13.c.250, and the name was borne as
a title (like that of ‘Caesar') by his
descendants till their fall before the
Sassanians in ab. 226.

5. acrior, ‘more energetie‘: cp.
‘acri....libertate' (A. 13. 50, 3);
‘vigor animi . . . . acrior' (A. 3. 30, 5).

libertus. Even kingly govemments

ol his army took place at Chartae in
Mesopotamia in tac. 53.

amisso et ipse Pacor0,‘and that
too couuterbalanced by the loss of
Pacorus': ‘ipse' is used of ‘Oriens' as
if the Parthian monarch had himself
been spoken of, and as if ‘amisso
Pacoro had beenan active past part.
in nominative, with an accus (aul αὐτὸς
ἀπολέσας Πάκορον). Pacorus, son of the
Parthian king Orodes, was defeated and
slain by Ventidius in Syria, luc. 38.

infra Ventidium deiectus, ‘cast
down beneath the feet of a Ventidius’
The antecedents of their victor are con·
ceived as adding bitterness to their
ultimate defeat. P. Ventidius Bassus,
a Picenian, and in early life led in
triumph in the Social war, and said to
have been a muleteer‚ had been advanoed
by Caesar and became consul in the
triumvirate, and gaineda triumph in
rae. 38 for driving the Parthians out
of Syria and Asia Minor, which they
had occupied as conquerors for nearly
two years.

7. obiecerit, ‘with what else could
the East taunt us.’

Carbone et cassio. Cn. Papirius
Carbo was defeated by the Cimbri in
Illyricum in Rc. 113 (Liv. Epir. 63).
Their next victory was that over M.
Junius Silanus, the consul of tac. 109,
in Gaul (Liv. Epit. 65). This Tacitus,
titt‘iilittttstiirthid}
Longinus, the consul of a.c.·107, which
took place in Gaul, but was at the
hands of the Helvetian Tigurini (Liv.
1.1.), who may have been in alliance

in Germany were not such ‘regna'as with the Cimbri, as were also the

those in the East: ep. c. 7, 1, &c
6. Crassi. His destruction and that
