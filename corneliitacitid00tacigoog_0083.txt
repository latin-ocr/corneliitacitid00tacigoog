70 CORNELII T ACIT I DE GERMANIA

feras et detracta velamina spargunt maculis pellibusque be-
luarum, quas exterior Oceanus atque ignotum mare gignit.
nec alius seminis quam viris habitus, nisi quod feminae saepius 3
lineis amictibus velantur eosque purpura variant, partemque
5vestitus superioris in manicas non extendunt, nudae brachia
ac lacertos; sed et proxima pars pectoris patet. quamquam4
severa illic matrimonia, nec ullam morum partem* magis
laudaveris. nam prope soli barbarorum singulis uxoribus
contenti sunt, exceptis admodum paucis, qui non libidine,
10 sed ob nobilitatem pluribus nuptiis ambiuntur.

9. cb libidinem C.

10. plurimis all, text Halm. ambiunt H.

ruder tribes could not then weave ior
themselves.

ut quibus, &c ‘as those dc who
have,‘ &c Cp. the similar ellipse in
c. ηις and the use oi ‘ut' inc. a, 4,
⁶ &cg For the sense of ‘cultus’ cp.
c. ,2.

1. detracta, sc‘ seris’: sor ‘velamina’
‘vellera' or ‘velamina ' have been sug-

ested.

g maculis pellibusque, hendiadys for
‘maculatis pellibus! They sew on
illibi} litii} sigepgppgffgugrgg·
loribus alas' (Verg. Aen. 7, 191).

2. exterior Oceanus, explained by
‘ignotum mare'; probably the Baltic
is meant. The traders in this region
would be the Suiones cs c. 44, a.

5. habitus, so used oi clothing in
Agr. 21,3; A. 1.69, 5, &c

4. amictibus, distinguished by some
from ‘vestitus' as the ‘sagum’ from the
‘vestis' but more probably intended as
ageneral term to mean that the material
oi their clothing, as a whole, was liax
(thatoithemenbeingprobablywoolleu).
That the Germane spun flax at this time
is attested by Pliny (19.1‚ 2, 8), and
implements ior spiuniug and wearing
are as old in Europe as the Swiss lake·
dwellings <Taylor, p. 171).

purpura, aborder or stripes of some
colour resembling purple dye.

5. vestitus, the tunic, as distinct
from the ‘braccae’; ‘superioris’ by
enallage (cp. c. 27, a) for ‘superiorem
partem,' the part to which sleeves would
be attached in the case os the men.
Such seems to be the contrast best suited

to the passage, 1110118118ὃῖ- takes the
comparison to be rather with the ‘ stola’
os Roman women. ⁸On the Antonine
column the women are represented with
an undergarment reaching to the feet,
and a short tunic over it. This tunic
has usually long sleeves, but in some
instances (see Bartoli, pl. 17, 49, 63)
exactly answers to the description here
given. ,

brachia ac lacertos, the iore-arm
and arm.

6. sed et: cp. c. 8, 3.

quamquam, 1. e. althoughtheir cloth-
ing may seem barely decent, their chas-
tity is remarkable. This forms the
transiticu 1ο a new subject. This word
is so used in the principal sentence with
the soree ol ‘however’ in Dial. 28, 33
33, 5·

8. prope soli barbarorum. This
statement is somewhat bold and does
not hold good os all Germane. SS
shows that polygamy was not forbidden
by their ancient laws, nor unusual in
north Germany, besides being excep·
ticnally practised elsewhere, as Tacitus
notes.

9. exceptis, &e., as au instance,
Ariovistus had two wives (Caes. 1.
1141·

libidine, ·causal abl. answering to
‘ob nobilitatem!

ιο. pluribus, ‘more than one ’z most
edd. retain ‘ plurimis' (‘ several ²).

ambiuntur, so ‘conubiis ambire'
(Verg. Aen. 7, 333); ‘auxiliis ambiri'
(H. 4. 51, a). Here it is used with

lrbrdrne' by zeugma, in the sense ol
‘ plures uxores habent.'
