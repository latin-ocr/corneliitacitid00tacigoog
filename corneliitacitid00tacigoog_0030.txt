THE ACCOUNT GIVEN ΒΥ YACITUS 17

determining the ethnology of the Venedi and Fenni he has no test 01
language to apply, and is only able to speak of their mode 01 1110 and
customs¹.

Another universal characteristic of the Germans 00 which he lays
stress, that of their physical appearance ², leads to a difficulty of which
we should think that he ought himself to have been aware; 101 100
peculiaritics on which he insistS, the ruddy hair, flashing blue eyeS,
stalwart limus, and otherS, agree equally with all Roman description 01
100 Gauls ³, ¹and it would seem that on this point, as well as in several
of theh other qualities⁴, no clear distinction between the races was
noticed by Greeks or Romans, and that it was long before they
were marked off at all. To Greeks at an earlier date all the north-west
of Europe was peopled by Κελτοί 01 Γαλάται ⁶: nor does Cicero distin-
guish the nationality of the Teutons and Cimbri from that 01 those
who had once pillaged Rome under Brennus ⁶. Caesar, the first to
distinguish clearly between Gauls and Germans‚ rests his 'distinction
not on physique‚ but on differences of religion and customs⁷ 3 and
Strabo, writing about 00. 10-20, is aware of no stronger physical
difference than that the German is an exaggerated Celt⁸. It should
00 remembered that by the time of Tacitus the Gauls had been so
greatly changed and enervated by a century anda half 01 subjection
asto be no longer liable to be confounded in respect 01 warlike spirit
and qualities⁰‚ and perhaps less so than formerly even in physical
appearance¹⁰, with the fiercc and unchanged Germane.
