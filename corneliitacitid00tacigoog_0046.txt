many errors and defectS, of which some have been already dwelt upon,
and others will be pointed out in the notes. In most of them the
blame may fairly be laid on defective means of knowledge, while in

unconscientiously used, and fidelity may have been sacrificed to

modelling itself on the ideas of a fading past, and too often keeping
silence as to elements of really decisive moment ³,' is to pass on it too

similar monograph of such fullness and value has come down to us;
and when we consider how the very transparency of the defects seems
even to point a contrast to the substantia] correctness of the rest, how
far the preponderance of what has stood the test of criticism and has
been confirmed by later knowledge goes to accredit what we have
no means of criticizing‚ and how much more we know through this
