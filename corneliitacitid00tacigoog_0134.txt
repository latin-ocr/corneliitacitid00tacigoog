sordes omnium ao torpor: ora,
&e Halm, Z., Mn, follow Heraus in
inserting ‘ ora,¹ which might easily have
dropped out. Others retain the MSS.
text, but differ in respect ol the stopping,
some putting a stop' after ‘torpor,’
others after ‘ procerum? The nomina·
tive by itsels is harsh ; some such words
as‘ propriae sunt ’ having to be supplied
with ‘sordes'3 and although it seems
clear that ‘omnium' is opposed to
‘procerum’ it is not so certain whether
the ‘sordes’ and ‘torpor' are meant to
be points of resemblance to Germans
(cp. e. 20, 1; 15, r) or ol differenee (c.
22, 13 14, 3). The latter view is most
in accordanee with the context here as
a whole; the whole passage ‘sordes . ..
traxerunt' being apparently a descrip-
tion οἱ non-German traits, and German
‘proceres' at least being generally
described as energetic (e. 13,14). Some
follow Urlichs in inserting the words
‘sordes . . procerum’ between ‘ dubito '
and ‘quamquam’ making ‘omnium'

· refer to all the three nations here men-

tioned.

a. habitum, ‘appearance’: cp. c.

lower type.

moribus, se. ‘Sarmatarum' in con·
trast to the mere ‘habitus,' as also
‘multum' to ‘nonnihil.’

tabuerunt, ‘have derived': cp. Α.
15. 8, 4.

erigitur, ‘lists itsell’: cp. ‘insula
. . . erigitur' (Verg. Aen. 8, 416).

peremant, perhaps more emphatic
than ‘ latrociniis'; lor Gernrans also
had plundering habits (c. 14, 5), though
less pronounced than those of less
settled tribes.

tamen. ‘in spite of these differenees!

5. domos figunt, ‘they construet
permanent houses': ep. (Frisii) ‘fixerant
domos’ (A. 13. 54, 3).

6. pedum, taken also with ⁴ pernici-
tate’ The Sarmatae relied only on the
‘pernicitas equorum,' aud were most in-
efficient on loot, most formidable on
horseback (H. 1. 79, 4).

7. Sarmatis, brachylogical lor ‘ Sar-
matarum moribus!

Fennis mira feritas. The three
nations are described in a descending
series; the Bastarnae differed somewhat
from the German type, the Venedi
more, the Fenni most of all.

8. non arma The bows and arrows
mentioned below are used to procure
foed and are not counted as arms.

non penates, ‘no houselrold’ (ep.
c. 15, 1), no regular dwelling place, in
contrast to ‘domos figunt' above.

9. vlotui, &cz lor these datives, ep.
c. 23,1.

herba. This seems plainly incon-
sistent with what is said of their hunting.
He may mean only that they had no ,
agricultural produce, and had to live
to a great extent on wild plants and

4. montium, the Οὐενεδικὰ ὅρη os roots.

Ptol.3.5,15. Nothing worthy ol the name
exists in this tract, but the Valda hills
near Novgorod, and the higher ground
in which the rivers rise may be meant.

oubile. Halm, after Whlfflin, reads
‘eubili,' to make the construction
answer to that of ‘victui’; but such
variations are common in Tacitus.
