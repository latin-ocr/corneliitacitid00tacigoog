PURPOSE OF THE TREATISE 7

heroic courage of its people, and the blows which they had intlicted
on Rome during more than two hundred years without any substantiai
conquest oi their territory ¹, so as to force him to own, in words that
at the end oi another century must have seemed prophetie, that only
the internal discords oi the race could avert the destiny which was
hurrying the Roman empire to its destruction ².

This ethical and political purpose, however insufficient to explain
the treatise as a whole, has poweriully influenced the treatment of
considerable portions³. ln exhibiting to his readers the great iree
people who alone among the nations had ever cast off the yoke once
laid upon them, and caused a distinct recession of the Roman srontier,
he would naturally use all his skill to idealize the vigorous and manly
qualities standing in the sharpest contrast to the enieebling luxury
and vicious degradation ot Roman contemporary life. Such con-
trasts ior literary effect are especially sought by Tacitus throughout
his writings ⁴, and have often iormed part ol the common stoclr ol
orators and poets‚ and such an idea had been already touched by
Horace⁶ in language showing a sufficiently close resemblance to the
thought oi Tacitus to suggest some common source oi both oi them⁶.

‘Campestres melius Scythae,
Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos,
Vivunt, et rigidi Getae,
Immetata quibus iugera liberas
Fruges et Cererem ferunt,
Nec cultura placet longior annua,
Defunctumque laboribus
Aequali recreat sorte vicarius.
Illic matre carentibus
I’rivignis mulier temperat innocens,
Nec dotata regit virum
Coniux nec nitido fidit adultero.
Dos est magna parentium
Virtus, ct metuens alterius viri
Certo foedere castitas3
Et peccare netas aut pretium est mori'
