through intermediate forms with that

all the Germanic peoples ofScandinavia.
They are viewed as consisting oi many

ipso in Oceano, in the midst of it,
as islands: some prefer the reading
‘ipsae' (ie. by themselves). Pliny
speaks (4. 13, 27, 96) os ‘Scatinavia'
as a great island of unknown size, and
Ptol. (2. 11, 34) of the Σκανδίαι as one
large and three small islands. aud a
similar opinion was prevalent ior some
time later.

3. utrimque, attributivewith‘prora'
(cp. c. 8, 1, &c.): ‘their double prow
presents a sront,’ &c Such vessels
were employed by Germanicus (A. a.
6, 2), and were in use among other
, nations (cp. H. 3. 47, 53 Plin. 6. 22,

districts of Sweden. A large boat of

5. solutum, ‘the oars are loose,’ so
as to be shiited easily, not secured to

7. eoquo unus imperitat, i. e. be-
cause he is preeminently rich. The
king's power seems really to have rested
on a religious ground (see note below),
and his wealth was probably rather
