They are probably the same who collectively form an inner council
or¹ senate ³, to decide lesser matters and to hold previous debate on
greater, besore their submission to the general body; and who dele-
gate one of their number to the supreme command in war4. They
are probably, again, the same who are spoken of as partly supported
by quasi-voluntarygistst, and as having the important privilege ol
keeping up and leading to battle a train of ‘comites' (see below,
p. 25). In this description, as far as it goes, we clearly recognize
the person known later as ‘heretoga,' ‘herzog’ or ‘duke’ in war, and
as ‘ealdorman’ or ‘gras’ in peace 6; however wide the gulf that sepa-

later times are chosen by the king, are hereditary, and often take the
title of the ‘Earl' or ‘Jarl ⁷.’

Tacitus seems to be betrayed into inaccuracy in his anxiety to point
a contrast to Rome. Domestic slaves may probably not have been

expect him tomention them ⁹, and describes to us only an extremely
mitigated form of bondage on the land, or sersdom‚ which he compares
to the condition os a Roman ‘colonus ¹⁰,' representing the bondsman
