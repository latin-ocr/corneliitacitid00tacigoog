100 CORNELII T ACIT J DE GERMANIA

dius quam tutius suit, quia inter inpotentes et validos salso
quiescas: ubi manu agitur, modestia ac probitas nomina
superioris sunt. ita qui olim boni aequique Cherusci, nuncu
inertes ac stulti vocantur: Chattis victoribus fortuna in sa-

5pientiam cessit. tracti ruina Cheruscorum et Fosi, muter-3
mina gens, adversarum rerum ex aequo socii sunt, cum in
secundis minores fuissent.

‘marcentia pocula' (Stat. Silv. 4. 6,
56); more commonly ‘enfeebled' (as
in H. 3. 36, a). Other causes, as in·
ternal seuds (A. 11. 16, 1), and constant
warfare with the Chatti (A. 12. 28, 2),
had no doubt also weakened them.
inlacessiti, only here and in Agr.
ao, .
nituerunt, ‘have indulged in.’

1. inpotentes: cp. ‘impotentia’
(c- 35· 3·

falso quiescas, ‘it is vain to think
oi being at peace' They must at least,
like the Chauci (c. 35, 4), keep up a
strong defensive force.

2. nomina superioris (so nearly all
edd), ‘moderatiori and justice become
the titles os the stronger’; ie. what is
so styled in their conduct is despised as
folly and cowarrlice (cp. ‘inertes ac
stulti') in the weak. 'she reading
‘nomina superiori‚‘ adopted by Halm,
would give the meaning ‘are names
(and nothing more) to the stronger';
a sense somewhat supported by ‘nomen
exercitas' (H. 4. ¹5· 6), but less suit·
able to the context. Among other
suggestions are ‘ignominiae superiori‘
(Halm), and ‘nomina ignaviae (cp.
Seu. Ep. 45, 7) superiori’ (Mulier).

3. olim, during their peaceiul lise:
‘vocati sunt’ is supplied from ‘vocan-
ωὙῳακῃ

4. Chattis victoribus. This victory
probably took place at the time (per-
haps AD. 85) when Dio mentions (⁶7.
5, 1) that the Cheruscan king Chario-
merus sought Roman aid against the
Chatti, but received from Domitian
only money.

in sapientiam cessit, ‘went sor
(was counted as) wisdom’: they were

believed to have planned out the suc·
cess which they really owed to luck.
Z. cites ‘ id illi in sapientiam cesserat,'
from a fragment of Sallust, and Tacitus
has ‘cedere in solatium' (H. a. 59, 5),
‘gloriam’ (A. 14. 54, 5).

5. traoti, ‘dragged in.' This al-
ternative for ‘tacti' is supported by
‘ quae .. . ruina suatraxit' (H. 3. ²9· 2),
and ‘Agrippinae pernicies. . . Plan·
cinamtraxit'(A. .26, 4).

Fosi, only here mentioned. It is
thought that they may have lived in
the district of Bmgdors, near the city
of Hanover, on the Fuhste, a small
tributary of the Aller.

6. ex aequo, ‘equally' (ἐξ ἴσου), so
in H. a. 77‚3; 97, a, &c Other such
adverbial expressions with this prep.
are found, as ‘ex sacili’ (Agr. 15,1;
H. 3. 42, 1), &c

now returns to it. It has been thought
that he may have wished to bring‘to·

oi Rome, but he certainly here does
not speak of the former as such. He
may have chosen to mention the Cimbri
last oi the non-suebic peoples, both as
being most remote, and because the
break in the narrative gave a good
place ior the appended digression. lt
hasbeen thought that this, or even the
whole chapter, show marks oi being e
a subsequent insertion by the writer.
