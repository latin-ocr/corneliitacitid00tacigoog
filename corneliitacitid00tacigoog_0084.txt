CAP. 17, 18. 71

18. Dotem non uxor marite, sed uxori maritus offert.
intersunt parentes et propinqui ac munera probant, munera
non ad delicias muliebres quaesita nec quibus nova nupta
comatur, sed boves et frenatum equum et scutum cum framea

agladioque. in haec munera uxor accipitur, atque in vicenis
ipsa armorum aliquid viro adfert: hoc maximum vinculum,

3haec arcana sacra, hos coniugales deos arbitrantur. ne se
mulier extra virtutum cogitationes extraque bellorum casus
putet, ipsis incipientis matrimonii auspiciis admonetur venire
se laborum periculorumque sociam, idem in pace, idem in proe- 10
lio passuram ausuramque: hoc iuncti boves, hoc paratus equus,

1. Dotem, &c Tacitus is here car· 6. ipsa . . . adfert. This agninis

ried away by the apparent contrast to
Roman custom. The nature of the
actual gifts goes to show (what is fully
confirmed by other evidence), that they
were not a dowry to the wife, but a gift
(like the Homeric ἕδνα) to her parents,
purchasing her, or. more properly, pur-
chasing the ‘patria potestas' (‘ mund·
walt,’ in mediaeval Latin ‘mundium')
over her. The Gallie women had ⁴ dos,'
and a kind of settlement in marriage
(Caes. 6. 19,1).

2. intereunt parentes, &c The
family was summoned to approve the
betrothal aud delivery of the wif .

munera probant, ‘examine and ac·
cept the gifts.’ The repetition of ‘ mu·
uera’ is considered by some au error of
the scribe ; the anaphora of substantives
being rare in Tacitus, and confined to
contrasted parallel sentences (Dial. 13,
²3A·1-1·7;592{{4·7423)· epfe-
cisely simtlar repetrtron of ‘munera rs

3. non ad, &c., i. e. not jewels‚ nor
articles of the toilet.

4. boves, &c These are paid as
value,as in the case of fines (c. 12, 2),&c.

5. in haee munera, ‘ with a view to·

orce of ‘in' is seen iu some passages
of Livy, as ‘in has . . . leges . . . ictum
goedus' (23. 34,1); also 34. 35,1; 4²·

it would seem, as a symbol to denote
that she passed under his power.

7. haee arcana sacra, ‘these as their

nearly obsolete (A. 416, 2) ceremony
of ‘confarreatio’

such meaning.
