internecine feuds might at times bring a hitherto unknown tribe
into prominence, or reduce a once famous name to insignificance
or even extinctionl, relegare a frontier nation to the forest recesses
of the interior, break up a large people into subdivisions with specilic
names ³, or otherwise alter the distribution of territory in ways not
afterwards traceable. It is thus perhaps hardly matter for surprise
