PURPOSE OF THE TREATISE 5

the ‘Dialogus’ represents his Ciceronian, we might say that the
Germania and Agricola represent his Sallustian period ; the influence
oi that writer being traced in the plan of the latter work ¹, and
perhaps as a source oi material in the formerl, as well asin the style
and language of both ³.

When it is asked, what particular reasons may have led Tacitus ‘to
choose this particular subject for such separate treatment, the explana-
tion is naturally songht in those parts of the treatise which show most
evidence of being written with a purpose: hence some have supposed,
from the descriptions of German hardihood and contage, andos the
disasters which Rome had suffered at their hands ⁴, that he desired to
tur-n men's thoughts from any idea of subjugating them 3 otherS, that
he intended to lash the vices of effete civilization by contrast with the
virtues of healthy barbarism¹⁵3 such explanations being plainly too
partial to account ior the treatise as a whole, which we cannot suppose
to have been written for the mere purpose of bringing in a few
telling passages ’

The abrupt beginning and ending oi the work have suggested the
idea that it was written lor insertion in the Histories⁶‚ and was ior
some reason afterwards taken out and published separately. The
‘situs gentinm' is certainly reckoned by Tacitus among the proper
subjects of history⁷3 and we have evidence of his practice in the
account of Britain in the Agricola⁸ and of the Jews in the Histories ⁹, as
well as of that of other writers ¹⁰. It is of course impossible to suppose
that such an excursus could have been intended to extend to anything
like the length of the present treatise: it is nevertheless possible that,
while on the one hand he may have come to think that he was writing
on no such era in the relations of Rome and Germany as to warrant
more than avery brief preparatory sketch‚ on the other, the richness os
material, the interest oi the subject, the consciousness that he could
correct and improve upon the work of his predecessors, may have· led
