and ‘ colles' of me latter ; i. e. the Chatti
begin within the mountain range, extend
continuously as it opens out, and end
where it ends. For other views see
SS²., K., and C. Β. Others would
adopt the v. l. ‘durans’ (referred to
‘initium ’), or read ‘durantes' (with
‘colles '). Pramm. strikes out ‘durant‘
altogether. Tacitus would appear in
any case to mean that the Chatti ex·
tended to the plain of north Germany,
which is incorrect.
¹ 1. prosequitur . . . . deponit: for
such personifications cp. ‘ bellurn ape·
ruit' (c.1‚1), ‘caespes erigit’ (c. 27, a),
and others noted in Introd. p. 11.

2. simul atque, here equivalent to
‘et’...‘et’: cp.c.12,3; 31,.4.

striati, ‘close knit' (C. B.), sinewy.

3. et, adding a mental quality to the
physical traits denoted by the asyndeta.

animi vigor, ‘ activity of mind' : cp.
Liv. 9. 16, 12.

ut inter Germanos (qualiiying
‘multum '), ‘as the standard is among
Germans' ; so ‘magno ut inter barbaros
praelio’ (as read by Halm in A. 11. 17,
5): ine 2‚4; 22, a, the meaning is
different.

4. rationis, ‘method ‘; the histori-
cal infinitives which follow are epexe-
getical nominatives in apposition.

praeponere eleetos. This is gener·
ally taken to mean that they had no
hereditary rulers (see Introd. p. 19, note
17): possibly the stress is on ‘electos'
They choose leaders caresully, and obey
them (‘audire'). Germana in general
did not obey the command ol their

leaders, but followed their example( .
7, ι).

5. nosse ordines, ‘know their place
in the ranks,’ like a Roman soldier in
his oentury. The Germana had an order
os battle (c. 6, 5), but less exact.

intellegere occasiones, ‘to notice
(not overlook) opportunities’t cp.‘terga
occasioni patefecit’ (Agr. 14, 4).

differre, ‘reserve ior the right
moment.'

6. disponere diem, ‘to map ont tbe
day‘ (have regular hours ior different
duties); so in Sen. Cons. ad Pol. 6,
43 Pl. Ep. 9. 36, 1; Suet. Tib. 11.

vallare nootem=‘noctu castra val·
lare' (make night saie by defences),

⁴ astrained attempt at concise antithesis

to ‘disponere diem.’ Cp. Introd. p. 9.
fortunam, &c., i. e. not to reckon on
luck.

8. eoncessum, ‘granted by the fa-
vour of heaven,’ a grandiloquent exag-
geration suited to Roman pride. Some
have adopted the reading ‘ratione dis·
ciplinae’ (‘by a system of discipline’).

plus reponere. more fully ‘ plus spei
repositum' (Livy, a. 39,1).

9. omne robur, somewhat stronger
than what is said of the Gemens gener·
allyin c. 6, 4: cp. c. 32, 2.

super, ‘besides,'a sense frequent in
and after Livy.

ferramentis, ‘tools,’ as spades, axes,
mattocka &c

10. copiis, ‘provisions ’ (H. 2. 32, 3,
δια).

ad proelium. . . ad bellumr ‘to
fight a battle’ . . . ‘to carry on a cam·
