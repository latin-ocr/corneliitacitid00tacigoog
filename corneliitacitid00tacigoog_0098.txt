cap. 26, 27. 85

ipsum nonin totidem digerunt species: hiems et ver et aestas
intellectum ac vocabula habent, autumni perinde nomen ac

bona ignorantur.

27. Funerum nulla ambitio: id solum observatur, ut eor-
2 pora clarorum virorum certis lignis crementur. struem rogi5
nec vestibus nec odoribus cumulant: sua cuique arma, quo-
rundam igniet equus adicitur. sepulcrum caespes erigit:
monumentorum arduum et operosum honorem ut gravem
defunctis aspernantur. lamenta ac lacrimas cit0, dolorem et
tristitiam tarde ponunt. · seminis lugere honestum est, viris 10

meminisse.

4. observant b and Haupt.

‘the com crop is the only tribute exacted
from the soil'

annum quoque. . ‚n0n=‘ne an·
num quidem) They do not even di·
vide the year into as many seasons as
we do. The old broad division of the
year, attested by Aryan langnages gene·
rally, and still used by Thucyd, is into
summer and winter, between which
spring and autumn are intermediate
stages, and the Germans had no name
sor the latter as a season. ‘Herbst' is
probably os later date, and more pro·
perly‘harvesttime,'whichwithRomans
would fall in summer. It is to be noted
that we have the Latin ‘autumn‘ with
English names for the other seasons.

2. intellectum, la meaning!

3. bona, such as the vintage, and
fruit gathering: cp. ‘pomifer auctum-
nus' (Hor.0d.47,11).

4. Funerum, &c This forms the
fitting epilogne to this portion.

nulla ambitio, ‘ there is no pomp' ;
in contrast to Romans, whose funerals,
especially by the addition of gladia·
torial shows, had risen to euormous
cost. The Gauls had become extrava-
satietisinattenuata
bedchlerlilrsenldiildlrs’ospddldidssodaslleenlb
implied to be, at this date, universal;
simple burial, as shown in the most
ancient graves, having perhaps become
obsolete or local. Cremation was abol-
ished by Christianity in the time ol
Charles the Great (Z.).

struem, defined by genii. ‘rogi’

6. vestibus . . . odoribus. Such
are described as burnt in honour ot
Germanicus (A. 3. 2, 2), and more than
a year's produce os the latter at that oi
Poppaea (Plin. 12. 18, 41, 83). SS.
notes that this practice came in later
among the Germans.

7. equus, that the dead might ride =
in state into ‘Wallralla.' The horse'of
Alaric thus shared his funeral (Z.);
there is also evidence that favourite
hounds, and sometimes slaves, and even
wives (see on e. 19, 3) were sacrificed.
Similar customs prevailed (Caes. l. l.)
at Gaulish funerals and among the early
Greeks (Hom. Il. 23,171-175).

caespes erigit. This rhetorical ex—

’ pression (cp. H. 5. 6, 4) seems taken

from Seu. (Ep. 8, 5), ‘hanc (domum)
utrum caespes erexerit an lapis. . .
nihil interest.'

8. monumentorum, such as those
at Rome, the mausoleum of Augustus,
pyramid ol Cestius, and·0ther great
family tombs, the ‘magnae moles se-
pulchrorum' of Sen. de Brev. Vit. ao, 5.

arduum.. honorem, enallage for
‘arduorum &c

gravem. Cp. the frequent epitaph
‘sit tibi terra levis.'

9. lamenta et lacrimas: sor the
alliteration cp. Introd. p. ιο, SS. notes
thatin later times passionate grief is
sustained sor three days, and the whole
mouming for seven or thirty days.

10. ponunt = ‘deponunt’: cp. ‘ad
ponendum dolorem' (Cic. Tusc. 3. 28,

lugere . . . meminisse. Tacitus
