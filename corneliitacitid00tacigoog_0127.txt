CORNELII TACITI DE GERMANIA

lenocinantur: nigra scuta, tincta corpora3 atras ad proelia
noctes legunt ipsaque formidine atque umbra feralis exer-
citus terrorem inferunt, nullo hostium sustinente novum ac
velut infernum adspectum ; nam primi in omnibus proeliis

soculi vincuntur.

44. Trans Lugios Gotones regnantur, paulo iam adductius
quam ceterae Germanorum gentes. nondum tamen supra
libertatem. protinus deinde ab Oceano Rugii et Lemovii3
omniumque harum gentium insigne rotunda scuta, breves

10gladii et erga reges obsequium.

6. LygiosBCc ligiosb. Gothones all, text Med. r inA. a. 62. regnant

most MSS. text c and two others.

r. lenocinantur, ‘add to the effect
ol' ; so in Dial. 6, 5 (‘ lenocinatur vo-
luptati'), and in Plin. mi. and Quint.

nigra, sc. ‘sunt'

tincta, ‘painted'

atras . . . legunt: cp. ‘electa nox
atra' (H. 5. 22, ι).

a. ipsa formidine atque umbra,
‘by the mere (cp. c. 13, 4) terrific and
shadowy appearance‘ (apart from their
fighting qualities).

feralis exereitus terrorem, ‘the
dread ol an army of spectres.’ This is
clearly the meaning conveyed by ‘in-
fernum’ below, and it seems best so to
take it here; but Wblfflin considers
that a new and distinctlystrougerfigure
is introduced by ‘ velut,' and that ‘fe-
ralis exercitus' should mean ‘an army
like a funeral procession' : cp. ‘feralem
introitunr' (H. 1. 37, 5). The other
meaning seems, however, to be sup·
ported by ‘feralibus . . . tenebris‘ (⁴ the
darkness of death ’y in A. a. 31, a. The
meaning ‘deadly or ‘deathbringing'
(as in ‘bellnm...t'erale' H. 5. 25, 5)
does not seem to suit the imagery here.

3. nullo hostium, the frequentTaci-
tean and poetical quasi-partitive geni·
tive, without any partitive idea. Cic.
would have said ‘nullo hoste!

4. velut infernum, ‘as it were
hellish.' The expression at least is
stronger than ‘feralis' is the meaning
conveyed is the same.

6. Gotones, the Gothi of later his·
tory. They are mentioned by Pliny
(9. 14, 28, 99) as a branch of the Van-
dili, and appear to have been among

8. Lemouii bl H M S, text B C e.

the subjects of Maroboduus (A. 2. 62,
a). Various authorities appear to agree
in making them live at this time on the
right bank of the lower Vistula, ex·
tending to the Pregel, probably the
river Guthalus of Pliny. At the begin·
ning of the third century they were on
the ‚Brack Sea.

regnantur (cp. c. 25, 3): the sol·
lowing words show that this reading is
right. Here the expression is concise
(they live· beyond the Lugii, and are
ruled by kings).

iam, probably best taken in a tem·
poral sense (cp. ‘nondum'), implying
that thepower of their kingswas getting
on: but cp. ‘ nullis iam' (ξ 3), and
c· 45, 2; 46, 6-

adductius, ‘more strictly' (a meta·
phor from a tightened rein): cp. ‘ adduc·
tius. . ,imperitabat’ (H. 3. 7, a), &a

7. supra libertatem, ‘so as to over·
power freedom‚’ as in Oriental des-
potisms.

8. protinus ab, ‘immediately bor-
dering on’ (in contrast to ‘ipso in
Oceano' below). These people pro·
bably lived in Pomerania, between the
Oder and Vistula. The name ol the
former is preserved further west in the
island of lliigen, and they were among
the later enemies ol Rome. The Le·
movii are unknown, and their name has
been taken to mean ‘a branch,’ and to
be perhaps a collective name.
