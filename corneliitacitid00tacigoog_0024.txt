et ira' (2. 25, 2), ‘similitudine et inertia' (c. 28, 4), ‘oblectationi
oculisque’ (2. 33, 2), ‘castra ac spatia’ (2. 37,1), ‘formidine atque
umbra' (2. 43, 6), or by stilted expressions for common things, as
‘ingemere agris inlaborare domibus, suas alienasque fortunas spe
metuque versare' (c. 45, 6), or by somewhat daring personification
or metaphor. We have few, if any, bolder figures in his works than
‘donec aetas separet ingenuos, virtus adgnoscat’ (c. 20, 2), ‘Chattos
suos saltus Hercynius prosequitur simul atque deponit’ (c. 30, 1),
‘obstitit Oceanus in se inquiri' (c. 34, 3¹).

If thus in some points the Germania approaches nearer to his earlier
manner, the traces ofa study or imitation of other writers show more
resemblance to his later. The Ciceronian phraseology so prominent
,in the ‘Dialogus' becomes supplanted by that taken from poets and Ι
historians. His evident admiration of Vergil already bears fruit in
his description of the sacred grove (c. 39, 2), and in such expressions
as ‘originem gentis' (c. 2, 3), 'bellatorem equum’ (c. 14, 4⁸, ‘vocare
hostem’ (2. 14, 5), ‘spina consertum’ (c. 17, 1), ‘nuptiis ambiuntur’

Horace seems to leave a trace in the coutrast of ‘ mores and leges'
(c. 19, 5), aud perhaps in ‘ferox bello' (c. 32, Ι4); Ouid in ‘pressos

and the use of ‘annus' 121 ‘annona’ (c. 14, 5). Among prose
authors, besides expressions borrowed from those from whom he is
known to have derived material ³, we trace Livy in ‘neque confirmare
neque refellere in animo est' (c. 3, 4), ‘saepta pudicitia'(c.19, 1),
‘urgentibus imperii fatis’ (2. 33, 2), and should probably trace him
oftener if his excursus on the Germans had been preserved to us ⁴.
