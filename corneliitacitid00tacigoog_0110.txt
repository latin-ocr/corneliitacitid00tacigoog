2. Frisii. These lived always be·

und their name is still preserved in that
01 Friesland. The distinction into

alone), may coincide with that oi Frisii
and Frisiabones in Plin. 4. 15, 29, 101.
They are first known as subdned by
Drusus, and as in dependence ou Rome
till their revolt in nn. 28 (A. 4. 72, 1),
then as again reduced by Corbulo in
run. 47 (A. 11. 19, 1), and as having
joined the revolt of Civilis (H. 4. 15.
43 79, 3). 11 is probable (see A. 13,
54) that the eastern portion, coinciding
with one 01 the divisions above given,
muined its independenee (see Momms.

Herculis columnas. At a later

Germany called ‘Irminstlli,’ apparently
columns surmouuted by a head, like
the Athenian Hermae. The word is
taken by Grimm to mean no more than
‘hnge pillars,’ but would no doubt be
popularly supposed 10 mean ‘pillars of
Irmin,' who is taken to be the German
Hercules (see Introd. p. 28). It is
