CAP. 23-25. 81

robustior adligari se ac venire patitur. ea estin re prava
pervicacia; ipsi fidem vocant. servos condicionis huius pe'r

commercia tradunt, ut se quoque pudore victoriae exsolvant.
25. Ceteris servis non in nostrum morem, dIscriptis per

familiam ministeriis utuntur: suam quisque sedem, suos 5
penates regit. frumenti modum dominus aut pecoris aut
vestis nt colono iniungit, et servus hactenus paret: cetera

1. adligari: this verb is used sor the adopt the reading ‘ discriptis’ (= ‘ scri·
simple ‘ligari ’ with the special sense oi bendo distributis‘); asimilar alteration
binding the hands or feet: cp. ‘adliga,in· having been made in most places where
quam, conliga' (Plaut. Epid. 5. a, 25). ‘describo' is found in MSS. with this

a. ipsifidamvocant. Tacitus would meaning.
not give such a term (‘h0nour’) to the 5. suam, &c., ‘each has a domicile
adherence to a bargain so disgracesul of his own and lords it there’ (like a
to both parties. He would rather call sree householder): on the sense os ‘ pe-
it ‘persistency’ (ί pervicacia '). nates,’ cp. c. 15, 1·. Tacitus is perhaps

servos condicionis huius, ‘slaves contrasting the ‘cellae’of Roman slaves

in this position,' those who become so
under these circumstances.

per commercia, ‘in traffic’; so of
persons ‘venumdati’ and ‘empti ’ (Agr.
28, 5; 39, 2): ‘tradunt’ sc. ‘aliis’

3. se quoque: a sense of shame
would be felt by both parties. H. Schiitz
would read ‘se quisque?

pudore victoriae exsolvant3 so
‘pudore proditionis exsolvere' (H. 3.
babeam

4. ceroma, in contrast to those above
described. Some would be slaves by
birth, others would become so by mar·
riage with such, or by captivity (cp. Agr.
anamumnamuvu
judicial sentence, or inability to pay
fines, or even by voluntary surrender,
or sale by husbands or parents (A. 4.
72, 4), to escape starvation: see Bp.
Stubbs, i. p. 84¹ Tacitus here describes
only one form os bondage, a kind of
seridom approaching to later villeinage‚
and ignores, or rather expressly denies,
the existence os slaves in the house,
though such are clearly alluded to else-
where (see c. 20, 2).

in nostrum morem: cp. c. 16, 2.

discriptis, &c ‘with distinct sunc-
tions prescribed throughout the estab-

(Hor. S. 1. 8, 8), and speaks rhetori-
cally‚ but the context shows that the
seri had land as well as dwelling. We
seem certainly to have here indicated
the existence os what are called depen-
dent villages, consisting of the mansion
os a lord with the cottages of seris
clustering round it, with small holdings
tenable at his pleasnre; a condition os
things from which the manor os later
date arises. Some consider that this
was the prevalent type of German vil·
lage at this date, and that the statements
in e.16, 1, and 26,1 can be explained
in accordance with this view (see D. W.
Rosa p. 1²4³ F. Seebohm, pp. 339,
soll). It is perhaps better to suppose
that there were variations which Taci-
tus omits to distinguish (see on c.16, Ι).
Probably he would have found the Ro·
man term‘ villa'(A.4.y3,7; H. 5. 23, 4)
better suited than ‘vicus' to describe
such houses with dependent hamlets.

6. frumenti modum. Such rents .
in kind are abundantly attested by later
evidence. It maybethatthe whole estate

· was parcelled out on these terms among

the seris, but if a portion was retained
in band by the lord we should suppose
that they hadftan additional obligation

lishment) Such separate departments to labour on it.

or functious of Roman slaves are abun-
dantly given in inscriptions. Most edd.

7. vastis, ‘ cloth‚' which they had to
spin and weave.
