that at an earlier as well as at a much later date many tribes were
thus governed ¹, and that the subsequent prevalence of kingly rule is
not due so much to a sentiment deeply implanted in the German
mind² as to other causes, partly to the prominence oi tribes belonging
of old to the Suebic or monarchical stems ⁸, partly to the consolidation
ol separate tribeS, and to the courses of movement and conquest which
tended to make a stronger central rule more needlul⁴, and led not only
to kingly government but to a very different type of it from that here
described, as military and victorious kings were able to gather more
into their hands, to surround themselves with a constantly increasing
‘comitatus' (see below, p. 25), and to become more and more lords
of the soil instead of being only leaders ol the people. '

As regards the other ranks ol German society, we find much of
what is more fully known to us at a later date already in existence.
We have the distinction between the mass of freemen (‘ ingenui') and
the ‘nobiles ⁶,’ answering to the English ‘ceorl' and ‘eorl‚' or to the
yeoman and the knight or esquire⁶. Both classes in some sense and
degree are landowners, and have the right of voting in assembly ⁷.

The ground of nobility is not indicated, but can hardly have been
any other than that oi supposed descent lrom divine or heroic
