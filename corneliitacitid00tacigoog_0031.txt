18 INTRODUCTION '

In the representation ol the character and institutions of the people,

ἲ we have a picture ol a race of Aryan speech and institutions at a stage
r? ol development on the whole peculiar to itself1. The resemblance
’ that will chiefly strike classical students is that to the Greeks of the
Homeric age ². Like these, they constantly bear arms in daily life³,
they show hospitality to the stranger no less than to friends ⁴, they
reckon value in oxen or other animals⁶, they get their wives bya kind
of purchase⁶, blood vengeance and its atonement by a ποινή are
recognized institutions ⁷, the⁴ kings are honoured by quasi-voluntary
gifts⁸, the submission of great questions, such as war and peace, to
a general assembly os the people, after previous discussion by the
chiels⁹, reminds us of the Homeric βουλή and ἀγορή ¹⁰, and the
tumultuous spear-clashing by which approval was indicated ¹¹, is but
a variation from the Achaean shout ¹².

On the other hand we notice no less striking and instructive
differences. ln some respectS, especially as regards the arts and
appliances os life, rhe Gennans are at a far lower stage, as we should
expect in a race remote from the Mediterranean, compared with those

who had long known Phoenician intercourse. Thus, although they ,

were living inan age notos bronze but iron, metal of all kinds is
scarce with Germana, the iron·tipped ‘framea' is the only universal
weapon, the shield is ol mere painted boardS, the sword and massy
spear and corslet are rare, the helmet in any form almost unknown ¹³,
a great contrast in all points to the Homeric panoplies. Again, even
the Homeric ship must have been some stages removed from the
northern sall-less boats ¹⁴, and a house far less splendid than the
