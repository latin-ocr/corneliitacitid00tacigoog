Civilis placed two sons of his sisters in
high commands (H. 4. 33, 1; 5. ao, 1).

4. heredes tamen, i. e. this tie does
not affect inheritance. In the term ‘li-
beri’ all direct descendants are iucluded;
butTacitus doesnotdistinguish between
sons and daughters, the latter of whom
toolr ancieutly no share, and subse·
quently but a small share of the inheria
tance. Nor does he state what took
place ifa man left daughters only, nor
mention the father as heir ιο a childless
son. Some custom of primogeniture is
alluded to in c. 32, 4.

nullum testamentum. This is in
accordaace with Indian and other early

usage, but in strong contrast to Roman
law. ‘It is doubtful whether a true
power of testation was known ιο any
original society except the Roman'

it was subsequently introduced into
Germauy.

elsewhere in Tacitus, but frequent in
Cic &c

8. nec ulla orbitatis pretia, a great
contrast ιο Rome, where the servility
of legacy-hunters gave a great social
power to those who were wealthy and
childless. See Hor. 2. 5‚10,foll. ; Juv.
4, 19; 12,99‚ and many other references
in note to A. 3. 25, a, and in Friedl. i.

ancient institutions, is recognized even
in the Mosaic code, and receives various
restrictions and modifications from law·
