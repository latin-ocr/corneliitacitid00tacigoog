1. curn C.

1. nationes, probably other Ger-
mans: cpe a, 5.

3. ancipitia, ‘perils'; so in H. 3.
40, 33 A· 14· 22, 4, &c-

clarescunt, ‘become reuowned,‘ so

· in H. 2. 53, ις Α. 4. 52, 23 11. 16, 5.

The sense seems taken from Lucretius.

4. tueare, with indefinite subject, as
‘instes' (c. 6, 6): ‘tuentur’ (read by
K, Mi, and Pramm.) has good MS.
support, but the change of subject with
‘exigunt' would be harsh.

exigunt, ac. ‘comites,‘ implied in
‘comitatus’: the gifts are a condition
of taking service. The preposition ‘a’
is inserted by most recent edd. after
Acid.: cp. H. a. ao, 2; A. 1616, a,
&a In later times the horse and arms
of the vassal are not a gift but a loan,
returned to the lord ou death (Kemble, i.
178),whence the modern custom ol ‘he-
riots' (Bp. Stubbs, Const. Hist. i. p. 2 5).

5. illum, ⁴ the usual' or ‘the much
longed for.' Tbere is no need to read
‘ ille,’ . . . ‘ill‘ess with Madvig.

bellatorem equum, from Verg. (G.
2, 145, δια). Tacitus takes from poets
many such adjectival uses of substan-
tives, as ‘imperator populus' (A. 3. 6, a),
‘mare Oceanus’ (A. 1. 9, 6), &e Also
‘ cruentam victricemque frameam ’ is the
lauguage of poetical anticipation.

6. nam epulae, &c It seems neces·
sary to take ‘epulae et. . . apparatus'
as a hendiadys for ‘epularum appara·
tus'(cp. c. 23,1; H.1.88,4; 2.62,2;

4. tuentur bb, text all others.

a, add. Aeid.

the latter word of the horse and arms
above. The force of ‘ nam' must be to
contrast ‘stipendio‘ with ‘liberalitas’
and ‘munificentia' They expect from
his bounty the horse and arms, for the
feasts which he gives them, on a liberal
though homely scale, are rechoned as
mere pay. Some take it to mean ‘they
expect these gifts only, for they demand
no pay beyond their susteuance.’

7. munificentiae, referring to ‘libe-
ralitas' above.

8. annum=‘annonam,’ ‘the yearly
produce'3 so in Agr. 31, a 4ι ager atque
annus ⁸), perhaps first in Lucan, as‘ rap-
tis annum flevere iuvencis’ (3, 453), &e

9. persuaseris: cp. ‘tueare ’above
The infin. with this verb is rare (Verg.
G. 2, 315; Nep. ; Sen.; Pliny ma).

vocare hostem = ‘provocare'
fromVerg. G. 4, 76; cp. ‘vocare offensas
(H. 4. 80, 3), &e

mereri, ‘to earn as awage ἐ cp. the
description in c.7 4.

ro. quin immo, in anastrophe, as in
Dial. 6, 23 39, 3: cp. ‘quin etiam’
(c. 3, 3, &c.), and others.

sudore . . . sanguine: the con·
trast is strengthened by the alliteration.
Caesar says of the Germans (6. 23, 6),
‘latrocinia nullam habent infamiam.
quae extra fines cuiusque civitatis fiunt ’;
but it is probable that Tacitus is think-
ing, in this whole passage, more of those
enrolled in a ‘comitatus' than of the
race in general.
